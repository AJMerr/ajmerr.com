If your focus is solely on updating the S3 bucket with changes to your HTML and CSS files, you can simplify the GitHub Actions workflow by removing the Terraform steps and using aws s3 sync to handle the deployment. Hereâ€™s a streamlined version of the workflow:
GitHub Actions Workflow for S3 Deployment

name: Deploy Static Website to S3

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master  # Trigger on pushes to the main branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # 1. Checkout the repository
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # 2. Configure AWS credentials
    - name: Configure AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-region: us-east-1 
        
    # 3. Deploy Static Files to S3
    - name: Sync files to S3
      run: |
        aws s3 sync . s3://your-s3-bucket-name \
        --exclude ".git/*" \
        --exclude "*.tf/*" \
        --delete
