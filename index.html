              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>Hey there! I’m Austin, and I’ve been passionate about all things tech for as long as I can remember. My love for IT started when I was a kid, taking things apart just to see how they worked (and sometimes even putting them back together). These days, that passion has grown into a full-blown love for Cloud Engineering. There’s nothing better than building something from the ground up and knowing it’s helping solve real problems.</p>
              <p>Outside of tech, I’m all about music—it’s my happy place. Whether I’m DJing a set, finding new tracks, or just vibing to my favorite playlist, music always keeps me inspired. I’m also big into gaming, where I get to flex my strategic side and unwind at the same time.</p>
              <p>Oh, and the coolest thing about me? I recently became a dad! It’s been a wild, amazing ride, and it’s given me a whole new perspective on life (and time management!).</p>
              <p>At the core, I’m just someone who loves to create—whether it’s building in the cloud, crafting the perfect DJ set, or leveling up in life and games. I’m excited to see where this journey takes me next!</p>
